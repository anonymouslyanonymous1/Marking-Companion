**Question 1:** One mark for any one of the following: • a quick walk (helps) • it can make a difference to your mood • immersing yourself in nature (helps) • you can switch off from worries • you can disconnect from civilisation • it gives you a well-deserved break (1)

**Question 2:** One mark for any one of the following: • conquering a mountain • hiking (a trail) • an evening walk • popping outside (in your lunch break) • forcing yourself off the couch • (enjoying an incredible) coastal walk (1)

**Question 3:** Reward responses that demonstrate how the writer presents her ideas about the importance of spending more time outdoors. Responses may include: • the use of ‘unhealthy and unhappy’, which immediately suggests there is a problem • the use of colloquial direct address and informal language: ‘Don’t get me wrong’, appeals to the intended audience and the use of direct address, ‘listen up’, attracts the reader’s attention • the reference to ‘cat videos on Facebook and binge on Netflix’ is light-hearted but also demonstrates that the writer is similar to and identifies with her audience • the use of numbering and sub-headings • the simile ‘like another limb’ is used to suggest how essential smartphones are to young people • the reference to ‘psychological studies’ adds weight to her argument • the use of imperatives: ‘ditch the Wi-Fi’, ‘get yourself outdoors’ • the use of listing: ‘the media, social platforms and smartphones’, ‘work, study or social-related’, ‘smartphones, computers and televisions’. These are all tricolons used to emphasise the extent of the problems • the positive description of the benefits of being outdoors: ‘strengthen our ability to concentrate’, ‘increase your attention span’ • the (alarming) list of symptoms of lack of vitamin D • the use of alliteration, ‘fantastic form’, which suggests to the reader how good it is • the use of listing identifies another set of alarming health issues which the reader would want to avoid: ‘high blood pressure, heart disease and obesity’ • the use of personal anecdote: ‘I can vouch for how much’ • the activity does not have to be ambitious: ‘a stroll in the park’, ‘mountain (of any size)’. This would reassure readers that exercise is accessible to all • the writer ends on a positive and upbeat final section: ‘you’ll start feeling much happier’ (10) • the use of 1st person (throughout) • the use of inclusive pronouns and direct address: ‘you’, ‘why not ditch the work’ • the colloquial and light-hearted style.

**Question 4:** One mark for any one of the following: • the first big hill • it was immediately tiring • the cold (was unyielding)/it was frozen • breathing hard • his heart rate increased/ heart kabooming alarmingly • he was hopelessly out of shape • his pack weighed way too much • he was ill-prepared • it was a struggle (1)

**Question 5:** One mark each for any two of the following: • reaching high ground/the summit • the chilled air • the smell of pine sap • the vegetation • sprawl face down/pressed by the weight of his pack/lies for some minutes • (reflecting in a distant) out of body way/light-headed • the lichen • looking at nature • roll over/unhook from his pack/struggle to his feet • the view is sensational • the boundless vista/wooded mountains • it was like heaven • it was splendid (2)

**Question 6:** Reward responses that demonstrate how the writer presents his experiences of his walk. Responses may include: • the use of contrasts in the initial paragraph. The ‘chuckling stream’ is contrasted with ‘brittle ice’ and ‘denser woods’. The sky, described as ‘hearty blue’, is contrasted with the ‘brown’ ground, which is reinforced by the repetition of ‘brown’ • the adjective ‘unyielding’ emphasises how bad the cold is • the list of his physical symptoms is both humorous and also worrying, ‘bug-eyed, breathing hard’, emphasised by the use of the onomatopoeia: ‘kabooming’ • the play on words (pun) of ‘weighed’ and ‘way too much’ adds humour • the use of short sentences • the repetition of ‘hopelessly’ and ‘way too much’ emphasises the difficulties the writer faced • the tricolon list, ‘Between the curtain of trees at every side, the ever-receding contour of rising slope before you, and your own plodding weariness’, highlights the confusion the writer feels • the repetition of ‘beyond’ and ‘another’ shows how apparently endless the walk seems to be • the use of ‘pitiless deception’, which suggests that the hills are alive and malign • the repetition, ‘ages and ages’, suggests how long it has taken and is quite child-like • the description of the high ground, ‘chilled air’, ‘vegetation is gnarled’, which is not entirely appealing • his behaviour, ‘past caring’, ‘sprawl face down’, which shows how tired he already is. This is emphasised by ‘reflecting in a distant, out-of-body way’ • the description of the view suggests it should offer compensation: ‘sensational’, ‘This really could be heaven’, ‘splendid’. This contrasts with ‘cannot escape’, which suggests he is trapped by his walk • the repetition of ‘seven miles’ is both humorous and emphasises both how it should not be a problem but it is • the (circular) repetition of ‘It was hell’ reminds the reader of how he felt at the beginning • the personification of the pack he is carrying, ‘something that doesn’t want to be lifted’, and the description, ‘profound heaviness’, helps the reader to understand the difficulty. This is further emphasised by the use of direct address to the reader: ‘Imagine’, ‘Don’t tell me…’ • the alliteration, ‘world of weariness and woe’, which highlights how miserable he is • the use of addressing the reader ‘you’ (throughout). (10)

**Question 7:** Responses may include the following points: Text One • starts with personal anecdote with a positive viewpoint: ‘make such a significant difference in my life’, ‘how enjoyable’ • uses numbered sub-headings to identify the benefits clearly • uses familiar situations: ‘work, study or social-related’, ‘finding it hard to concentrate’ • uses inclusive pronouns, ‘we’, ‘you’, which presents the ideas as something we all encounter • gives positive reasons: ‘extremely positive impact on your mental health’, ‘help combat many health issues’, ‘magnificent what a bit of fresh air can do to you’ • is reassuring ‘whether it is a stroll in the park’ • ends on an upbeat note: ‘you’ll start feeling much happier’. General points candidates may make on the whole of Text One • the friendly, colloquial style • there is a direct connection with the reader: ‘you’ • the positive approach. Text Two • makes an initial positive comment: ‘wooded valley with a chuckling stream’ • quickly becomes negative: ‘immediately tiring’, ‘the cold was unyielding’ • identifies the difficulties: ‘hopelessly out of shape’, ‘weighed way too much’, ‘so ill-prepared’ • suggests the experience will never end: ‘always more hill’, ‘ever-receding’, ‘gradually lose track’ • shows how exhausting the experience is: ‘sprawl face down’, ‘lie there for some minutes’, ‘struggle’ • has some positivity: ‘could be heaven’ • ends on a downbeat note: ‘the wandering trail ran on’. General points candidates may make on the whole of Text Two • the use of direct address: ‘you’ • the use of humour • the overall negative approach. Points of comparison • Text One is advisory and informative/Text Two is entertaining and humorous • Text One is aimed at young people/Text Two is aimed at the general public • Text One presents walking outdoors as a positive experience/Text Two presents it as mostly unpleasant • Text One is not about a single experience/Text Two is about a single trek • both texts are based on the writers’ experiences • both texts are about walking in the outdoors • both texts address the reader personally • both texts clearly convey the writers’ ideas, experiences and perspectives.
