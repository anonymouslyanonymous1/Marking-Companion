 he contrasts this with the description of Number Six: ‘marble mansion’, ‘towering’, ‘like a permanent taunt’ (simile)
 the focus on the security of the mansion suggests Ashok and Eketi are doing something wrong
 this is supported by Eketi’s behaviour: ‘sliding up the trunk’, ‘launched himself like a human arrow’, ‘flew through the air and landed’
