**Question 3:** Reward responses that demonstrate how the writer presents her ideas about the importance of celebrations.  Responses may include: the opening paragraph directly addresses the readers, ‘Think of’, to engage them; the writer uses the pronoun ‘you’, which directly addresses the audience and engages them with the topic; the writer uses a tricolon of positive words, ‘to congratulate, celebrate and show affection’, which highlights the activities associated with celebrations; the use of ‘A Thing’, which is capitalised and uses an informal phrase to relate to a (wider) younger audience; the writer uses historical references such as ‘pharaohs’, ‘written in Latin’, to present how long we have been celebrating; this is reinforced by the use of dates: ‘3000 BCE’, ‘100 CE’ and ‘12th century’; the writer gives examples of other celebrations to appeal to a wider audience: ‘Eid or a career milestone’. This suggests that celebrating has many different contexts; the use of occasional questions, ‘where does our urge to collectively rejoice actually come from?’, which makes the readers think and engages them with the topic; experts are used, ‘Dr Sheri Jacobson’, ‘Patrick Fagan’, to add authenticity to the article; specific examples, ‘adrenaline’, ‘serotonin’, ‘oxytocin’, are used to show that there is scientific/medical evidence which might impress and persuade the readers; the repetition of ‘gratitude’ by Pamela Jacobsen emphasises the appreciation that celebrating can show; the use of ‘deviation’ in the final paragraph is contrasted with ‘life-affirming’ to suggest that the behaviour is a good thing; the use of contrast: ‘bringing structure to a world which is chaotic and frightening’, which emphasises the importance and value of celebrating; the use of inclusive pronouns throughout, ‘we’, ‘us’, which engages the reader; the upbeat ending: ‘is about as uplifting as it gets’, which leaves the reader feeling positive about the importance of celebrations.
