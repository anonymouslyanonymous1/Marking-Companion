Question 3: Reward responses that demonstrate how the writer presents her advice about learning a new skill.

Learn by Doing’, which shows the different aspects of learning a new skill • the alliteration of ‘Pick a Passion’ enlivens the text • the use of a tricolon, ‘time, focus and concentration’, to emphasise that learning something new requires hard work and dedication/organisation • the writer balances negatives and positives, ‘tired and confused’ and ‘success and mastery’, to impress on the reader the positive outcomes • the writer uses a reassuring example, ‘If you're learning to surf, you might start off by’, which explains how to start learning • the writer uses 'mastered this aspect' to show that even small steps should be regarded as progress • the short sentence, 'Alternate between researching and practicing.' attracts the reader's attention and would be remembered • the description of time as 'your most valuable asset' would show the reader that it is not just ability but the time you spend learning • the writer's use of 'quality time' suggests to the reader that learning a new skill requires undivided attention. This is further demonstrated by the use of 'dedicate' • the use of modern examples of distractions, ‘Instagram’, ‘Netflix’, which helps engage with young people and shows the writer has a good sense of her intended audience • the text ends on a positive note: 'you can make a lot of progress in a short amount of time' • the use of a reassuring tone throughout: ‘will be much easier’ • the use of direct address, ‘you’, and the use of inclusive pronouns ‘us’, ‘we’, which makes the audience feel included • the tone is semi-formal which gives the text some authority.
