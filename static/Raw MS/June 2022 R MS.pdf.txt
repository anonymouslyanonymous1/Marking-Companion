**Question 3:** Reward responses that demonstrate how the writer presents his advice for treasure hunters. Responses may include: • the opening paragraph is enticing: “hoard of gold, silver, textiles and jewels”, “£2 million”, “£44,000”, “worth £10 million” • the writer uses names and places to provide authenticity: “Derek McLennan”, “Scotland”, “David Blakey”, “East Yorkshire”, “Reg Meade and Richard Miles”, “Jersey” • the writer suggests that time is critical: “almost 1.3 million finds uncovered in the 20 years since the Treasure Act”, “uncovered at a fast rate in Britain” • has a positive attitude towards treasure hunting: “Buried treasure is not only real, but still being uncovered” • the use of questions: “how do you find buried treasure and can you keep it if you do?”, “What counts as treasure then?” • the use of direct address “you” • uses sub-headings to identify clearly the important advice: “get equipped”, “get permission”, “report it” • the use of bullet points • offers explanations for the equipment: “they often buried it deep”, “ensuring you don’t end up searching the same area” • mentions organisations which are involved in treasure finds, “The Treasure Valuation Committee” and laws “Treasure Act”, to explain how regulated treasure hunting is • this is reinforced by the mention of “three months in prison” and “A former policeman was recently jailed for 16 months” • identifies what the law regards as treasure so the reader is clearly informed • the use of statistics/numbers – many examples • the colloquial/informal style: “What counts as treasure then?” (10)

**Question 6:** Reward responses that demonstrate how the writer presents his opinions about treasure hunting. Responses may include: • the first sentence grabs the reader’s attention • he presents the hunt negatively: “going on for many years”, “without success” • the use of “far-fetched stories” suggests his disbelief • “trains stuffed” and “for still unknown purposes” suggest that the story is dubious • the humorous “raiders of the lost Nazi treasure” is a reference to the film Raiders of the Lost Ark • the use of “nonsense” reinforces his opinion • the alliteration of “spoilsport scientists”; the word “spoilsport” shows the attitude of the treasure hunters • the italics “their techno gadgets” contrasts with the seekers’, “latest techno gadgets” • the use of single-sentence paragraphs to engage the reader • he describes the difficult places where treasure is supposed to be: “remote”, “difficult to access”, “most desolate” • “futile attempts” suggests how pointless the searches were • the descriptions of the map: “giving a vague location”, “obscure origin”, “helpfully found” suggest that it will not be reliable • the use of “guardians”, “primitive savages”, “stop at nothing”, “intrepid treasure hunters”, “fabled hoard” is reminiscent of a story or film, which is supported by the reference to “Indiana Jones” • “treasure tales”, “mythology” and “folk beliefs” all suggest that he does not believe in the stories • the final paragraph contrasts with the rest of the article, giving examples of successful treasure hunts: “Spanish treasure ship”, “recovered sunken treasure” • the metaphor “stoke the fires of hope” suggests that successful finds encourage treasure hunters to believe in the legends • it ends on a tantalising note with the use of ellipsis. (10)

**Question 7:** Responses may include the following points: Text One • starts optimistically with examples of successful treasure hunts: “In 2014, Derek McLennan found a Viking treasure hoard” • clearly identifies information that a treasure hunter needs in sub-headings: “Step 1” • (directly) addresses the reader “you” • uses factual examples “The Treasure Valuation Committee” and “The Treasure Act” to add authenticity • refers to legal requirements: “get permission”, “report it” • assumes that there is treasure to be found: “most of the major finds happen in the countryside”, “Norfolk has produced the most finds”. General points candidates may make on the whole of Text One • presents treasure hunting in a positive light: “Buried treasure is not only real but still being uncovered” • uses sub-headings and bullet points • has an informal style • uses statistics: “1,292 discoveries”. Text Two • shows scepticism about treasure hunting in the initial paragraph: “at least, that’s what a couple of treasure hunters told the world last year”, “Many still believe in these far-fetched yarns” • presents treasure hunting as unsuccessful: “looking for years but no-one has succeeded” • gives examples of unsuccessful treasure hunts: “lost city of Z”, “Lasseter’s Reef”, “Beale ciphers” • uses language that suggests the writer doubts the accuracy of the stories: “fabled”, “yarn”, “tale”, “mythology” • despite the negativity, gives examples of successful treasure hunts in the final paragraph: “recent rediscovery of a Spanish treasure ship off Colombia”. General points candidates may make on the whole of Text Two • presents treasure hunters as foolish and misguided • uses factual examples to support perspectives: “Scientists from the Krakow Mining Academy”, “Colonel Percy Fawcett” • adopts a disparaging tone towards treasure hunting • is a third-person account. Points of comparison • Text One offers practical advice/Text Two comments negatively on treasure hunting • Text One is about the UK/Text Two uses examples from around the world • Text One only mentions successful finds/Text Two mainly comments on unsuccessful searches • Text One refers to legal information/Text Two does not comment on legality • Text One uses direct address/Text Two is a third-person article • Text One is advisory/informative/Text Two is informative but (slightly) mocking • both texts are about treasure hunting • both texts clearly convey the writers’ ideas and perspectives. Reward all valid points.

**Question 8:** A suitable register for a talk to peers should be adopted. Candidates should address all areas. The following are some points that candidates may make but there are other possibilities. Some candidates may interpret the task more widely and use other examples than those mentioned in the passages. Advice for treasure hunters • make sure you have the right equipment • make sure you have permission to search • take care of anything you find • report your finds to the appropriate authority • look outside of urban areas • use technology • listen to scientists What might be found • coins • gold and silver • jewellery • Viking treasure • Celtic coins • Roman coins • lost cities • (pirate) treasure • shipwrecks Problems that might be experienced • difficulties getting permission • damaging finds • legal proceedings • dividing proceeds from the sale with the landowner • dangerous locations • remote locations • a dubious map or document • being attacked • other people might get there first.
