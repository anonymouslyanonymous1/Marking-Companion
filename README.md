# Reason Behind Making It
Back when I was in IGCSE, I used to face a difficulty when doing past papers. 

The issue being the halt in my progress of doing past papers due to the inability to seek feedback on the essays I used to write. 

I didn't have an English teacher, at least not one to whom I could send my essays for review. 

So I used to use search for AI checker. It's not like there were no AI Checkers, there are. But none were specific to the Edexcel 4EB1 Paper. These papers have specific markschemes with certain points which all need to be covered for attaining good marks. 

Thus I made Marking Companion. It has a vast library of 4EB1 Papers with all the corresponding marking schemes analysed. 

Irrespective of where you are, what device you are using, you would be able to sit for any of the 4EB1 Papers and get rapid validation about your attempt at the paper.
